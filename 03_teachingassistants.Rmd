# Teaching Assistants

The teaching assistants for 431 this year are Bob Winkelman, Satyakam Mishra, Maher Kazimi, Zuxi (Terry) Cui and Xueyi (Julia) Zhang. They are the people answering `431-help at case dot edu`, and they are the people holding the bulk of our regular office hours. Most of them has been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. Many have volunteered their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course.

To contact the TAs, email `431-help at case dot edu`, which is open all semester, starting on January 22.

## Office Hours for TAs

Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in either WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building in the School of Medicine, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. The weekly schedule is: 

Date | Time 
--------: | --------------
Mondays | 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM
Tuesdays | 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:45 PM

He received his undergraduate degree from Carnegie Mellon University where he majored in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. Before coming to CWRU for medical school, Bob also worked for Epic, an electronic health record vendor, in Wisconsin. Bob took 431 and 432 two cycles ago and has appreciated how the skills he learned in those classes have helped him with his clinical outcomes research at Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health. Bob enjoys playing flag football, exercising, cooking, reading, and listening to podcasts.
