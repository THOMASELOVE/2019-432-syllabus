# Deliverables and Grading

## Timing and Deadlines

The [Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/calendar.md) is the most up-to-date resource for all deadlines in the course.

## Grading

The final course grade is weighted as follows:

- 15% Class Participation / Group Work / Minute Papers
- 25% Six Homework Assignments
- 25% Two Quizzes
- 35% Two Projects, including the Final Portfolio Presentation

A cut point to discriminate A vs. B will be set in the range of 85% to 90% at the end of the term. An average of 70% or higher is required to receive a B.

## Participation in the Course

Students are required to participate actively in the course, including meaningful contributions in group work, in-class and minute paper participation, emails to 431-help, visits to the TAs, etc.

- We're more concerned about the breadth of your participation rather than just its quantity.
- If you're having trouble asking questions, the best way to make a contribution is to find something interesting and share it with us, through 431-help.
- Most students score between 80% and 100% on this element.
